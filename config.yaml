# The Interpolation algorithm used to resize the images.
# Available algorithms:
#   "BiLinear" - High quality but slow
#   "NearestNeighbor" - Fast but low quality. Good for downscaling
#   "CatmullRom" - Highest quality but slow
#   "ApproxBiLinear" - A mixture of the nearest neighbor and bi-linear. Fast but medium quality
algorithm: "CatmullRom"

# Number of resizing doing at the same time.
# Highest values means doing faster but consuming more memory and maybe crash your Function.

# The format that the image will be resized to.
# If empty it will be the same as the original
# Available formats:
#    "webp"
#    "jpg"
